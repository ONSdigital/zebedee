# Zebedee

**NOTE: We are currently in the process of deprecating this service due to:**

- _Performance limitations_
- _Maintainability issues_
- _Inability to scale effectively_
- _Limitations of the underlying HTTP framework_

***

Zebedee is the CMS used by the ONS website and the internal website publishing system. It is a JSON API and does not
have a user interface. It comes in 2 flavours:

## zebedee-reader

Zebedee-reader is read-only. It's used by [Babbage][1] (the public facing web frontend of the ONS website) it returns
the published site content as JSON.

## zebedee-cms

Zebedee-cms is an extension of zebedee-reader. It's used by [Florence][2] and provides API endpoints for managing
content, users, teams and publishing collecions. Zebedee-CMS is not public facing and requires authentication for the
majority functionality. Pre-release content is encrypted and requries the appropriate permissions to be able to
access it.

## Prerequisites

- git
- Java 8
- Maven
- Docker

As mentioned Zebedee is a JSON API,  and does not have a user interface. The quickest and easiest way to use it is to
set up a local copy of the "publishing" stack. Clone and set up the following projects following the README instructions
in each repo:

- [Florence][2]
- [Babbage][1]
- [Sixteens][5]
- [dp-compose][6]

### Getting started

***
_If you encounter any issues or notice anything missing from this guide please update/add any missing/helpful
 information and open a PR._

_Much appreciated._
_The Dev team_
***
_NOTE_: The following set guide will set up Zebedee in **"CMS"** mode as this is typically how the devlopers will run 
the stack locally.

Getting the code:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ONSdigital/zebedee.git
```

### Database...

Zebedee isn't backed by a database instead it uses a file system to store json files on disk ***. As a result it
requires a specific directory structure in order to function correctly.

***
*** _We know this is a terrible idea - but in our defence this is a legacy hangover and we are actively working
towards deprecating it._
***

To save yourself some pain you can use the [dp-zebedee-content][3] tool to create the required directory
structure and populate the CMS with some "default content" - follow the steps in the [README][3] before going any further.

Once the script has run successfully copy the generated script from `dp-zebedee-utils/content/generated/run-cms.sh` into
the root dir of your Zebedee project. This bash script compiles and runs Zebedee setting typical dev default
configuration and uses the content / directory structure generated by dp-zebedee-utils.

You may be required to make the bash script an executable before you can run it. If so run:

````bash
sudo chmod +x run.sh
<Enter your password when prompted>
````  

### Running the publishing stack

In order to use Zebedee you will need to have the following other project running:

- Florence
- Babbage
- Sixteens
- dp-compose
- dp-identity-api

Follow the steps in the README of each project.

#### Zebedee content

Zebedee needs contents before it can be run. Basic demo content and file structures can be generated via the
[dp-zebedee-content][3] by following the instructions in the
[dp-zebedee-content readme](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-zebedee-content/blob/master/README.md)

#### Running zebedee

```bash
./run.sh
```

Assuming Zebedee has started without error head to [Florence login][4] and login with the default account:

```txt
email: florence@magicroundabout.ons.gov.uk
password: Doug4l
```

- If it's the first time logging in you will be prompted to change the password for that user.
- On the home screen create a new collection.
- Click `Create/edit` on the Collection Details screen.

If everything is working correctly you should now see the the ONS website displayed in the right hand pane.
_Congratulations_ :tada:! Advanced to GO collect £200 :dollar:

Otherwise :violin: kindly ask someone from the dev team to help troubleshoot.

### New Central Keyring configuration

The new central keyring feature is currently behind a feature flag:

```bash
export ENABLE_CENTRALISED_KEYRING=true/false
```

- If enabled Zebedee will attempt to read/write from the new central keyring and default to the legacy keyring if
unsuccessful.
- If disabled Zebedee will add/remove keys from both legacy and central keyring implementations but will
only read from the legacy keyring.

The central keyring requires encryption config to be provided in app configutation. These secrets can be generated
using the [collection-keyring-secrets-generator][7].
