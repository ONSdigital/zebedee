  "lede": "These statistics tell us about the changing picture of businesses operating in the UK. A merger occurs when two companies or organisations of a similar size agree to join together in order to operate as one single company under a new name. An acquisition is a transaction which involves one company purchasing the shares of a second company which is usually of a smaller size. Other statistics here are on \u0027disposals\u0027, which refers to a company or organisation selling or liquidating an asset or subsidiary. ",
