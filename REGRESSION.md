## Background

Zebedee has limited test coverage, both for end to end and for unit testing. This document represents the start of
trying to build this up to facilitate ongoing maintenance as well as helping onboarding by describing it's behaviours.
By building up regression test packs and then automating, we will increase confidence in updates we do to Zebedee. It is
reaching end of life, but there will still be ongoing changes to the code base as dependencies are upgraded and
functionality is decommissioned.

## Functionality
