  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

This error affects expenditure estimates for January to September 2014 and has resulted in the UK Statistics Authority suspending the National Statistics designation of the expenditure series within the Overseas Travel and Tourism releases until the figures have been corrected.\n\nThese data feed into the UK Trade release as imports and exports of services and the errors led the UK Statistics Authority to [suspend](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-andrew-dilnot-to-john-pullinger-141114.pdf \"suspend\") the National Statistics designation of UK Trade on 14 November 2014 following a request from the National Statistician.\n\nCorrected expenditure estimates for UK residents’ visits abroad and overseas residents’ visits to the UK will be published for all months, January to September 2014, and Quarter 1 and 2, as soon as possible. Please note that the UK Trade time series data are also affected by this error and will be updated with the corrected data when it becomes available.

The trade in goods deficit widened by £0.3 billion compared with May 2014.\n- In June 2014, exports of goods decreased by £0.4 billion to £23.5 billion reflecting falls in oil and manufactured goods. Imports of goods decreased by £0.1 billion to £32.9 billion reflecting falls in imports of oil and aircraft; these falls were offset by increases elsewhere in manufactured goods.\n- The falls in both exports and imports of goods in June 2014 were attributed to a decrease in trade with countries outside of the European Union (EU).\n- In Q2 2014 exports of goods decreased by £0.5 billion to £71.3 billion reflecting a decrease in exports of oil. Imports of goods increased by £0.4 billion to £98.7 billion reflecting increases in imports of ships, cars and medicinal \u0026 pharmaceutical products.\n"

      "title": "Summary",
      "markdown": "The deficit of trade in goods and services for June 2014 was £2.5 billion, compared with £2.4 billion in the previous month. The deficit on trade in goods was £9.4 billion in June 2014; the trade position reflects exports minus imports.\n\nExports of goods decreased by 1.6% between May and June 2014 to £23.5 billion, reflecting a £0.2 billion fall in exports of fuels, a £0.2 billion fall in semi manufactured goods and a £0.2 billion fall in exports of finished manufactures. Within fuels, oil exports fell by £0.1 billion and within finished manufactures, aircraft and ships combined fell by £0.2 billion.  Erratics, which include aircraft and ships, accounted for around 60% of the overall fall in exports of goods in June 2014.\n\nImports of goods for the same period decreased by 0.4% to £32.9 billion, reflecting a £0.4 billion fall in imports of fuels; specifically oil imports which fell £0.3 billion. Imports of manufactured goods as a whole rose by £0.1 billion in June 2014, however, there were significant individual falls within manufactures; imports of aircraft fell by £0.6 billion and imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products fell by £0.3 billion. These decreases were offset by increases elsewhere, notably imports of cars (which rose by £0.2 billion) and silver (which rose £0.1 billion).\n\nIn June 2014, exports of goods to the European Union (EU) remained unchanged at £12.0 billion; a £0.3 billion fall in exports of fuels was partially offset by a similar sized rise in exports of manufactured goods. Imports of goods from the EU increased by £0.5 billion to £17.6 billion, reflecting an increase of £0.2 billion in imports of manufactured goods and a further £0.1 billion rise in imports of fuels (primarily oil).\n\nIn June 2014, exports of goods to countries outside of the EU decreased by £0.4 billion to £11.5 billion, reflecting a decrease of £0.5 billion in exports of manufactured goods; finished manufactures (specifically aircraft) and chemical manufactures (specifically medicinal and pharmaceutical products) each accounted for £0.2 billion. Imports from countries outside of the EU decreased by £0.6 billion to £15.3 billion. Imports of fuels (specifically oil) and finished manufactures (specifically aircraft) contributed £0.5 billion and £0.2 billion respectively to the overall decrease.\n\nTrade statistics for any one month can be erratic. For that reason, it is recommended to compare the latest three months against the preceding three months and the same three months of the preceding year.\n\nThe deficit of trade in goods and services for Q2 2014 was £6.9 billion compared with £5.5 billion in Q1 2014 and £4.2 billion in Q2 2013.\n\nThe deficit on trade in goods between Q1 2014 and Q2 2014 widened by £0.9 billion to £27.4 billion.  Exports of goods decreased by £0.5 billion to £71.3 billion in Q2 2014, reflecting a decrease in exports of fuels; specifically oil exports which fell by £0.7 billion. Exports of semi-manufactured goods fell by £0.4 billion, within which both chemical manufactures and material manufactures fell by £0.2 billion. Imports of goods increased by £0.4 billion to £98.7 billion in Q2 2014. Imports of manufactured goods rose by £1.0 billion over the quarter, reflecting increases in the import of ships, cars and medicinal \u0026 pharmaceutical products. These increases were partially offset by oil imports falling £0.3 billion from the previous quarter.\n\nExports to EU countries increased 1.5% between Q1 2014 and Q2 2014, whereas exports to countries outside of the EU decreased 2.9% for the same period.  Conversely, imports from EU countries decreased 0.3% whereas imports from countries outside of the EU increased 1.2% between Q1 2014 and Q2 2014.\n\nExports to Germany, one of the UK\u0027s biggest trading partners, stood at £7.7 billion in Q2 2014, an increase of £0.6 billion compared with Q1 2014.  However, imports from Germany rose £0.6 billion over the same period to £14.3 billion.\n\nFor both EU countries and countries outside of the EU imports fell between Q2 2013 and Q2 2014 but exports have fallen more.  The biggest change is a £4.7 billion (11.9%) decrease in exports to non-EU countries including the USA, India and Canada.  Exports to Russia fell by £0.2 billion on the year.  In terms of commodities, exports of erratics such as silver, precious stones and aircraft to countries outside of the EU fell on the year.\n\nThis bulletin also reports on trade in services. However, the information on trade in services is mainly obtained from quarterly surveys, in some cases underpinned by larger annual surveys. That means that the data for the latest months are inevitably uncertain.\n\nThe surplus on trade in services for Q2 2014 was estimated at £20.5 billion compared with £21.0 billion in Q1 2014.  Both exports and imports fell over the quarter.\n"

      "title": "Longer-Term Perspective",
      "markdown": "The value of trade in goods grew steadily from the beginning of 2007 to mid 2008. The onset of the global economic downturn in mid-2008 affected the economic performance of the UK\u0027s major trading partners, and the value of both UK exports and imports fell sharply until Q2 2009. Growth in the value of trade in goods resumed from mid-2009 with improving global economic conditions. However, the value of both UK exports and imports have remained largely flat since mid-2011 with the continuing difficulties in many economies.\n\nIn 2013, the deficit on trade in goods narrowed by £0.8 billion to £107.9 billion (annually). The level of exports increased to a record £304.8 billion in 2013, up 1.4% from £300.5 billion in 2012.\n\nHowever, the rise in exports was accompanied by an increase in imports to a record £412.6 billion in 2013, up 0.9% from £409.2 billion in 2012. Despite these record levels of exports and imports, annual growth in the value of trade in goods has slowed considerably since 2010 and 2011.\n"

What\u0027s New?**\n\n**Article on changes to the measurement of trade**\n\nOn 10 June 2014, ONS published an article \u0027 [Methodological changes to the measurement of Trade due to the introduction of new international standards](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/national-accounts-articles/impact-of-esa2010-and-bpm6-on-trade/index.html \"Methodological changes to the measurement of Trade due to the introduction of new international standards\") \u0027 describing changes that will be implemented from September 2014 to how trade will be measured in the National Accounts, in order to comply with European statistical guidelines.\n\n**Revisions**\n\nIn this release, periods from April 2014 are open for revision.\n\n**EMU Enlargement**\n\nAs of 1 January 2014, Latvia joined the European Monetary Union (EMU). Therefore the EMU totals in this UK Trade release include Latvia.\n\n**2. Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) Fraud**\n\nUsers should also be aware that for some data prior to April 2012, the monthly data does not sum precisely to the quarters for the MTIC series due to rounding.\n\n**3. Special Events**\n\nAn article outlining the [ONS policy on special events](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/general-methodology/special-events-group/index.html \"ONS policy on special events\") is available on the ONS website.\n\n**4. Code of Practice for Official Statistics**\n\nNational Statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/the-national-statistics-standard/code-of-practice/index.html \"Code of Practise - G\u0026M\"). They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference. © Crown copyright 2014.\n\n**5. Short Guide to UK Trade**\n\nEver since statistics on exports and imports of goods were first collected in 1697, UK trade has been one of the country’s key economic indicators.\n\nAll information included in the monthly UK Trade statistical bulletin is on a Balance of Payments (BoP) basis and is seasonally adjusted unless otherwise specified. The release contains tables showing the total value of trade in goods together with index numbers of volume and price, figures analysed by broad commodity group (values and indices) and according to geographical area (values only). In addition the Trade statistical bulletin also includes early monthly estimates of the value of trade in services.\n\nData appearing in the UK Trade statistical bulletin are also used as a direct input into the quarterly Balance of Payments and National Accounts.\n\n**Interpreting the data**\n\nMonthly commodity movements for food, beverages \u0026 tobacco, basic materials, fuels other than oil and erratics (ships, aircraft, precious stones, and silver) are only detailed in this statistical bulletin where they are equal to or exceed £200 million (£400 million for three-monthly comparisons).\n\nMonthly country movements are only detailed in this statistical bulletin where they are equal to or exceed £0.1 billion (£0.3 billion for three-monthly comparisons).\n\nIn months where quarterly and three-monthly ending percentage changes for index data coincide, there may be small differences between the data for methodological reasons. Quarterly data are the indexed form of an underlying constant price (for volume indices) or consistent quantity (for price indices) series. Three-month ending data are the average of the index data in that period.\n\n**VAT Missing Trader Intra Community (MTIC) fraud**\n\nImport figures for trade in goods include adjustments to allow for the impact of VAT MTIC fraud.\n\nThe adjustments to trade in goods relate only to part of the carousel version of VAT MTIC fraud. This fraud leads to under recording of imports as fraudsters import goods from the EU, which they then sell on before disappearing without paying VAT on that sale. The goods are eventually exported. Such exports are declared and are therefore already reflected in the UK’s trade in goods statistics.\n\nChanges to the pattern of trading associated with MTIC fraud can make it difficult to analyse trade by commodity group and by country as changes in the impact of activity associated with this fraud affect both imports and exports. However, the MTIC trade adjustments are added to the EU import estimates derived from Intrastat returns as it is this part of the trading chain that is not generally recorded. In particular, adjustments affect trade in capital goods and intermediate goods - these categories include mobile phones and computer components, which are still the most widely affected goods.\n\nInternational convention determines that the treatment of the impact is to adjust imports upwards by the relevant amounts of missing declarations (non-response). However, users may wish to interpret short term movements in imports excluding that part of the fraudulent activity that is not included in the import estimates.  For this purpose an analysis of the import figures with the VAT MTIC adjustments excluded is shown in Table 13.\n\n**Definitions and explanations**\n  \nA glossary of terms is published in the [UK Balance of Payments - The Pink Book, 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bop/united-kingdom-balance-of-payments/2013/index.html \"UK Balance of Payments - The Pink Book, 2013\").\n\n##### Use of the data\n\nUK Trade is a key economic indicator due to the importance of international trade to the UK economy. It is also a very timely statistic, providing an early indicator of what is happening more generally in the economy.\n\nIn addition, it is a major component of two other key economic statistics: UK gross domestic product (GDP) and the UK Balance of Payments. This means that there is a threefold potential for UK Trade statistics to inform the government’s view of the UK economy, as well as the views of others, such as economists, City analysts, academics, the media and international organisations.\n\n**Notes on tables**\n\nRounding:\nThe sum of constituent items in tables does not always agree exactly with the totals shown due to rounding.\n\nSymbols:\n- ..Not applicable\n- -Nil or less than half the final digit shown.\n\n**6. Methods**\n**Composition of the data**\n\nDetailed methodological notes are published in the [UK Balance of Payments - The Pink Book, 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bop/united-kingdom-balance-of-payments/2013/index.html \"UK Balance of Payments - The Pink Book, 2013\").\n\n**Seasonal adjustment**\n\nSeasonal adjustment aims to remove effects associated with the time of the year or the arrangement of the calendar so that movements within a time series may be more easily interpreted.\n\n**Deflation**\n\nIt is common for the value of a group of financial transactions to be measured in several time periods. The values measured will include both the change in the volume sold and the effect of the change of prices over that year. Deflation is the process whereby the effect of price change is removed from a set of values.\n\nChain-linked indices (chained volume measures) which are indexed to form the volume series in this bulletin differ from fixed base indices in that the growth from one year to the next is estimated by weighting the components using the contribution to value of trade in the immediately preceding year (effectively re-basing every year). This series of annually re-weighted annual growths is then ‘chain-linked’ to produce a continuous series.\n\nThe implied price deflators derived by comparing current price data to chained volume measures data are not the same as the price indices published in this statistical bulletin because the former are current weighted while the latter are base (2010) weighted.\n\nChanges in trade associated with VAT MTIC fraud mean that comparisons of volume and prices (both including and excluding trade associated with VAT MTIC fraud) should be treated with a great deal of caution.\n   \nA [paper (384.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/gss-methodology-series/gss-methodology-series--36--statistics-on-trade-in-goods.pdf \"GSS Methodology Series #36 - Statistics on Trade in Goods\") , Statistics on Trade in Goods (GSS Methodological Series No. 36) describing the adjustments that need to be applied to conform to IMF definitions for Balance of Payments and the division of responsibility between ONS and HMRC is available on the ONS website.\n\nThe [Overseas Trade Statistics (OTS)](http://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/NonEUOverseasTrade/AboutOverseastradeStatistics/Documents/GSSMethodspaper%20v5.1.pdf \"Overseas Trade Statistics (OTS)\") data used as inputs to this statistical bulletin are collected and published by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on an International Merchandise Trade Statistics (IMTS) basis.\n\n**7. Quality**\n**Basic quality information**\n\n**Accuracy**: Trade in goods figures for the most recent months are provisional and subject to revision in the light of (a) late trader data, revisions to trade prices and revised estimates of trading associated with VAT MTIC fraud, and (b) revisions to seasonal adjustment factors which are re-estimated every month.\n\nTrade in services estimates have been derived from a number of monthly and quarterly sources. For components where no monthly data are available, estimates have been derived on the basis of recent trends. The results should be used with appropriate caution, as they are therefore likely to be less reliable than those for trade in goods.\n\n**Reliability**: Revisions to data provide one indication of the reliability of key indicators. The table below shows summary information on the size and direction of the revisions which have been made to the data covering a five-year period. A statistical test has been applied to the average revision to find out if it is statistically significantly different from zero. An asterisk (*) shows that the test is significant. An article explaining the past revisions performance for UK Trade statistics and what is being done to improve the first published estimates was published on 9 May 2005 on the ONS website.\n\n**Table 12: Revisions Analysis, UK Trade, June 2014**\n\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table:\n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/june-2014/ptl-table-12--revisions-analysis--uk-trade--june-2014.xls \"XLS format\") (30.5 Kb)\n\nThe table covers estimates of UK trade first published from September 2009 (for July 2009) to August 2013 (for May 2013).
